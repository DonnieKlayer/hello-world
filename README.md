# hello-world
My name is Donnie Klayer. I'm a 49 year old husband of 28 years and a father of three. I've always enjoyed cartooning, computers, gaming, and coaching. I'm looking forward to learning as much as possible about coding and hope to one day create an app for comic strip cartoonist to share and sell their comics. Thanks for the opertunity to lean. -Donnie
